### Overview
Take a Javascript file on UFO sighting information and display it as a table. We will add filters to make this table fully dynamic, making it to where it will react to user input. We will also put it on an HTML page for easy and clear viewing. You'll customize your webpage using Bootstrap, and equip your table with filters that will allow the user to interact with the data.
### Results
The user is able to type in the search fields which criteria they want to filer by. You can use one or all of the fields.

- Adding a drop down menu for the date range could be useful for users who don't have access to the dataset. This would be easier than typing random dates and searching that way.
- The user interface in the html is too dark and hard to read, however it was what I was instructed to use in the module.
